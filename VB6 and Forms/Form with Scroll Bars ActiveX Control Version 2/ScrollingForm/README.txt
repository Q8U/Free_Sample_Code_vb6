========= EB8 Scrolling Form ActiveX Control v. 2.0.9 ===========
=================================================================

DESCRIPTION:

I just have done a major update! This Scrolling Form Control has 
everything that you always dreamed of on a Scrolling Form and more! 

Following is a list of the most important features available on
this versatile ActiveX Control: 

(1) The Form will scroll vertically and horizontally! 

(2) It will scroll automatically to the field with focus if the 
field is out of site. 

(3) It will highlight the field or button that has the Focus 
(Actually, any Control inside of the Scrolling Form that can get 
focus). 

(4) Besides been able to optimize the space on your applications 
by been able to scroll in any direction, you can now flip pages! 
This feature is much like a wizard's page. The control will track 
the number of added pages and which page is currently been viewed. 

(5) The control will memorize the last field selected and the scroll 
bars position on every page. Therefore, whenever you move to a new 
page, you can opt to have the Scrolling Form ActiveX automatically 
select the last field selected on the corresponding page or select 
the first field of the page. 

(6) The Control can automatically select the text of every Text 
Box selected.

(7) You can add a background picture to the control. This picture 
will be set as the background picture of every added page! 

(8) You can set the background color of the control. This color 
will be set as the background color of every added page! 

All of these features are neatly packed as an ActiveX Control. It 
is very easy to use! The Source Code of the OCX is included and 
is heavily commented!!

INSTRUCTIONS:

Please, click on the "vbgExample.vbg" to see the example of the
control with source code.

INSTALLATION:

I added a Zip file called "OCX.zip". This file has the compiled 
ActiveX Control and a Visual Basic example. To run this Visual Basic
example, you have to register the ActiveX Control in your system. 

I added a file named "Easy DLL_OCX Register.reg". This file, if 
executed, will add 2 options to the context menu that appears when 
you right-click on a file with the ".ocx" or ".dll" extensions. The 
options added are "Register" and "UnRegister". You will be able, 
then, to register any OCX or DLL file just by right clicking on it 
and selecting "Register".

You can, also, register the ActiveX file manually. Just click on the
Start button and select Run. At the Run window, type "regsvr32.exe "
followed by the path of the OCX that you want to register. To avoid 
problems, you should always copy the OCX files that you intend to 
register into the System folder. If you copied the files to your 
system folder, the command line would look like this:

regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\System32\ScrllngFrm.ocx

To add this control to your project:
  1. Open a new Visual Basic Project.
  2. Click on the Project menu option and select Components.
  3. At the Components window, scroll down to the control 
     "EB8 Scrolling Form ActiveX Control v 2.0.9" and check it.
  4. Now, click on the OK button and the Scrolling Form icon will be 
     availeble at the Toolbox bar.
