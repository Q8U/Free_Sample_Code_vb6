ActiveX OCX to access and control any multimedia device 
installed , and it can detect and control also unknown

and change the volume sound or the mute state of any

mixer will work fine in any sound card already 
developed or any other that will be developed in the future .

This control tries to be as smart as possible

This control will make a full search and test in any 
device detected in your system

Then it will verify the presence of the known 
devices ( Wave , Midi , Master ) , and make some tests to 
verify the possibility to access this device

It will get any information that can make difference in 
the method that the system mixer need to be handle

During the full search , if some unknown device was 
found , it will be listed with the description and the 
required data that will be necessary to access this 
device

Known problems

If you have more than one sound card , then only the 
first detected by the system will be handled

Despite the possibility to detect the other sound card 
or mixer , at least this version will only handle 
the first one
