Advanced ZIP Password Recovery 2.44 [ASP]
-----------------------------------------
Forgot your ZIP password? Don't worry, this
utility may help you to guess it. The
program uses the "brute-force" attack, based
on the options you set (minumum/maximum
password len, character set, password mask);
dictionary-based attack is also available.
All ZIP versions and methods are supported.
The performance is more than one million
passwords per second (on Pentium II).
