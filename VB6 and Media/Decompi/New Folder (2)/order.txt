Advanced ZIP Password Recovery: how to order
============================================

You can register your copy of AZPR at a cost of $30. Select one
of the following ways:

1. Through the World Wide Web. This is the fastest and easiest
   way.	Your credit card information is sent directly to the
   credit card processor in a very secure manner, so that
   nobody else can see it. That protects you by ensuring that
   nobody but you and the credit card processor will see your
   card.
   For details on ordering AZPR through the Web, please go to
   the AZPR page at:
     http://www.elcomsoft.com/azpr.html
   and follow the link "Order the Fully Licensed Version of AZPR".
   Or, you can go directly to the order page:
     https://www.regnow.com/softsell/nph-softsell.cgi?item=1170-6&referrer=7

2. You can also register the program by sending us the purchase order,
   or money order, or cheque -- look at the order form ("order.frm").
   Phone and fax orders are accepted as well. Please don't send cash to
   our mailing address.

3. We do accept wire transfers to our bank account. Please contact
   our order department (orders@regnow.com) asking for the invoice
   for product 1170-6. You'll be charged for extra $10, however (bank
   fees). For other types of payments (online/mail/phone/fax), there
   are no additional charges.

On payment approval (usually, in a few minutes after you'll
register -- for online orders), we'll send you the registration key
which will remove all limitations of unregistered version, such as
maximum password length. Your registration will be valid for all
future versions of AZPR.

If you will not get your registration key within a reasonable
amount of time (two business days for credit card payments or
two weeks for other payments), please notify us about that!
We're very sorry for any inconvenience caused by those delays.
