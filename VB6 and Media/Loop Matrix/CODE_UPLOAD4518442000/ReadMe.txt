I wrote this program as part of a larger program called the "Sound Engineers Compaion" that I am writing for a assighment at collage.

I have not tested if the skins will work but if you wish to change the way the progam looks then put the original jpeg,s ino a new folder and make your own ensuring the names are kept the same and in the same dir.

These jpeg files should be in a folder called "skins"

Border2
Border3
button

The following samples that came with the program must also be kept for the program to run. These should be in a folder called "Sound"

Beat1.wav
Beat2.wav
nowoman.wav
stab.wav

The rest can be deleted if you do not like them.

The two folders "skins" & "Sound" should be in the applications folder

BUGS:
	There is a bug that i can not sort so if any one can please let me know how you did it.
Here it is. 
       When the program is playing moving the mouse causes the timing to wonder. I blame it on a  microsoft fault. "ha" don,t we all.

Problems:
	This program will only run if you have DirectX7 so if you do not it,s all over the web. Download it and install it my program should work then.

I did not create the excellant module a man called D.R.Hall did so all praises for that to him please.
