Encrypts files into CyT files, Like winzip. Has a 6 seconds encryption of a 6 meg file and an extraction of 6 / 10 seconds to extract a 6 meg
file. Input any file including exe's and zip's. I MEAN ANY FILE. Has it's own click and open file types. Good dialog graphics and comes
with a CyT file that you can extract which is full of icons, drag CyT file into the compiled exe or double click on the CyT file
after using the reg file in the zip to register the file type.
