--------AND MORE---------

Very fast and easy coding.
Works like winzip.
Takes about 6 seconds for a 4 Meg file to be encrypted into archive.
Takes about 6 seconds / 12 to extract from CyT file.
Such simple code, you really can't find a bug.
Re-enter archive and add more files.
See shaded icons in the file lists.
Good dialogs (Main form and Versions form)

Disadvantages!

Can't delete out of file, need to create a new archive. - But now working on it!
