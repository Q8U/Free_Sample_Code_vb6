ICQ Control Center Was Written by me Digital Vampire
translated from the mirabilis documentation and other.

the project lastest well over 6 months --------------

everything else included in this zip file was by their
respective owners. I just thought it might be nice to
be able to get everything you wanted to know from one
place, as opposed to the months of hunting the net that
I had to do.
