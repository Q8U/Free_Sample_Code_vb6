Title: URL Coder / Decoder
Description: When submitting data to a web site (either in the URL or as Form data), the data needs to comply to certain standards (URLEncode) as certain characters are not allowed as part of the form data or the URL. These routines will convert the string you supply to the correct URLEncoded string and decode them again if required.
