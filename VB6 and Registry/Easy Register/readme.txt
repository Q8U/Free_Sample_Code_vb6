 If you are developing ActiveX components, you truly 
 know that "REGSVR32.EXE" isn't the luxurious program 
 available.

 Xteq COM Register Extension makes it much more easier: 

 Simply right-click an OCX, DLL or EXE file and select 
 "Register ..." or "Unregister ...". This will either
 register or unregister the selected component from 
 the registry. 

 Forget REGSVR32.EXE forever!
