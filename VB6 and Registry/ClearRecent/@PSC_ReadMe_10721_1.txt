Title: ClearRecent: Clear out entries in your Recent Projects list!
Description: Sick of having a thousand files in your recent section when you start VB? Tired of scrolling through pages of not-so-recent files? THEN THIS IS FOR YOU! Clear out all the entries in your recent section, or clear out specific ones! This is especially for the app, not really the code, but it teaches you to use registry calls with API (don't ask me - I borrowed the registry code, although it does have instructions).
