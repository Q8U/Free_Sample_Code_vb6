With d2 Register/Unregister DLLOCX 2.0 it's much quicker: 
Simply right-click an OCX or DLL file and select "Register control"/
"Unregister control" (for OCX files) or "Register library"/"Unregister
library" (for DLL files) from the appearing menu. These commands will
call "REGSVR32.EXE", so you don't have to type it yourself.
