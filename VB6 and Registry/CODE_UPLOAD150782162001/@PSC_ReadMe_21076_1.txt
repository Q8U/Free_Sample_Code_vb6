Title: A  .inf file for registering / Unregistering your object libraries..
Description: This power of this code is in the .INF file that updates the registry to put the functionality of "REGSVR32.EXE" on the menu.The d2 Register/Unregister DLLOCX 2.0 is a 2nd generation release. If you are developing ActiveX components, you totally know "REGSVR32.EXE" isn't part of RAD at all. With d2 Register/Unregister DLLOCX 2.0 it's much faster; Just right-click an OCX or DLL file and select "Register control"/ "Unregister control" (for OCX files) or "Register library"/"Unregister library" (for DLL files) from the appearing menu.
