Title: An Amazingly Simple Way to Read/Write Registry Entries
Description: This is the simplest way of reading and writing to the registry with the least amount of code...bar none! Don't bother with the Windows API to perform simple Read/Write/Delete in the registry! Just set a reference to "Registry Access Functions" (RegTool5.dll) in Project | References. It can be found in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Tools\APE. Press F2 to view the Object Browser and see the wonderful functions already there for you!
