Title: cIDV3
Description: MPEG Tag Viewer/Edit and MPEG File Info class module. Allows TAG viewing editing, and returns info on the MPEG file itself like Copyrighted, Seconds, Bytes, Mpeg Version, Layer Version, KBits, Hz, Mode, Private, CRCs, Original, Emphasis, and Channels. I know there is alot of code for editing a TAG but I wanted something that would allow for editing the TAG and viewing the info on the file. Hopefully some of you will help to improve on this code and please email me any updates. Thanks... BTW: I included a short example program on how to use the class module for anyone who doesn't know about class modules.
