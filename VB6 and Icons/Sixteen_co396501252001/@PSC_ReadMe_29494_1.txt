Title: Sixteen color Icon Editor
Description: Second version Icon Editor: I am now using VB 6.0 with service pack 5! It still only edits 16 color icons (32X32) but can now read from multiple-icon files as well as 16 color bitmap (32X32) files. The code has been cleaned up from the original version. Originally, I wrote this program because I had no way of creating my own icons for VB 3.0, and I could not find a good icon editor on the internet. This program fills that need. Hopefully it will help others in PSC. All comments, suggestions, and votes are appreciated! - Gregg
